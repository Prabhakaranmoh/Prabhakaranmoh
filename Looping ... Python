# Example: Iterating through a list using a for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Example: Iterating through a range of numbers
for i in range(5):  # Will loop from 0 to 4
    print(f"Iteration {i}")

# Example: Using break to stop the loop early
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Stops the loop when i is 5
    print(i)
